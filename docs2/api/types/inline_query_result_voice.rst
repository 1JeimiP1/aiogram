Represents a link to a voice recording in an .OGG container encoded with OPUS. By default, this voice recording will be sent by the user. Alternatively, you can use input_message_content to send a message with the specified content instead of the the voice message.

Note: This will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will ignore them.
